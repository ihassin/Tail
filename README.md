Tail & TailUI
=================

Tail is a real-time file monitor and viewer, is a Windows port of the UNIX 'tail -f' command.

Tail can display the last part of a large file quickly without loading the entire file. And it can be used to view the end of a growing file. Tail is a file viewer only, it makes no changes to file.

TailUI is the GUI program of Tail.


Options
----------

**-f, --follow[=name]** 
Output appended data as the file grows; -f, --follow, and --follow=name are equivalent.

**-r, --retry** 
Keep trying to open a file even if it is inaccessible when tail starts or if it becomes inaccessible later; useful when following by name, i.e., with --follow=name.

**-F** same as --follow=name --retry

**-n, --lines=N**
Output the last N lines, instead of the last 10.

**-s, --sleep-interval=S**
With -f, sleep for approximately S seconds (default 1) between iterations.

**-h, --help**
Display this help and exit.

**-v, --version**
